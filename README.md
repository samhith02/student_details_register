Here's a detailed outline for designing a system to store, manage, and delete student data with three tiers of login access:

1. Database Design:
Student Data Table: Contains fields like student ID, name, contact information, courses enrolled, etc.
Faculty Data Table: Includes fields such as faculty ID, name, contact details, courses taught, etc.
Admin Data Table: Stores admin ID, name, contact information, privileges, etc.
Login Credentials Table: Stores username, hashed passwords, and role (Student, Faculty, Admin).
2. User Authentication:
Student Login: Access to view/edit own profile, enroll in courses, view course materials, submit assignments.
Faculty Login: Access to view/edit own profile, manage courses, grade assignments, communicate with students.
Admin Login: Access to manage student and faculty data, create/delete user accounts, view system logs.
3. Privileges and Access Control:
Student Privileges:
View/Edit Own Profile
Enroll in Courses
View Course Materials
Submit Assignments
Faculty Privileges:
View/Edit Own Profile
Manage Courses
Grade Assignments
Communicate with Students
Admin Privileges:
Manage Student Data (add, edit, delete student profiles)
Manage Faculty Data (add, edit, delete faculty profiles)
Create/Delete User Accounts
View System Logs
4. User Interface:
Student Dashboard: Shows enrolled courses, assignments, grades, profile management options.
Faculty Dashboard: Displays courses taught, student lists, grading tools, profile management options.
Admin Dashboard: Provides access to manage users, view system logs, perform data management tasks.
5. Data Management:
Add/Delete Student Data: Only accessible to Admin.
Add/Delete Faculty Data: Only accessible to Admin.
Manage Courses: Accessible to Faculty and Admin.
Assignments and Grading: Accessible to Faculty.
Profile Management: Accessible to all users for their respective profiles.
6. Logging and Security:
Logging: Record all login attempts, data modifications, and system activities in a log file.
Security Measures: Use secure hashing algorithms for storing passwords, implement HTTPS for data transmission, and regularly update security protocols.
By following this structure, you can create a robust system that efficiently manages student data while ensuring proper access control and security across different user roles.
